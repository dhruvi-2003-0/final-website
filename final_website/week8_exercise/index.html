        <h1>First Incident of Gandhiji</h1>
        <div class="anim-1">Gandhi was appalled by the discrimination he experienced as an Indian immigrant in South Africa. When a European magistrate in Durban asked him to take off his turban, he refused and left the courtroom. On a train voyage to Pretoria, he was thrown out of a first-class railway compartment and beaten up by a white stagecoach driver after refusing to give up his seat for a European passenger. That train journey served as a turning point for Gandhi, and he soon began developing and teaching the concept of satyagraha (“truth and firmness”), or passive resistance, as a way of non-cooperation with authorities.</div>

            <p style="position: relative; z-index: 4; padding: 0px 100px; text-align: center;top: 68%;"> In the Transvaal, the conditions for Indians were harsher than in Natal. They faced a £3 poll tax, could only own land in designated ghettos, lacked voting rights, and were restricted from walking on pavements or being outside after 9 p.m. without special permission. Once, despite having an authorization letter from the State Attorney to be outdoors at any time, Gandhi was abruptly pushed off the pavement and kicked into the street by a policeman near President Kruger's house.</p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 100px; text-align: center;">During his stay in Pretoria, Gandhi explored Christianity and read extensively about religion, but didn't convert. He soon delivered his first public speech on business integrity, addressing the oppression of local Indians. He also tackled discrimination in railway travel, securing a compromise for "properly dressed" Indians to access first and second-class tickets. These experiences led to his development of Satyagraha.</p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 100px; text-align: center;"> The first discriminatory legislation directed at Indians, Law 3 of 1885, was passed in the South African Republic, or the Transvaal. Two bills were passed in the following two years restricting the freedom of Indians severely. After his work in Pretoria, Gandhi returned to Durban. At a farewell dinner in April 1894, he read a news article about a proposed bill to disfranchise Indians, which he called "the first nail into our coffin." He urged resistance, but his compatriots felt helpless without him and asked him to stay another month.</p>

            <p style="padding: 0px 100px; text-align: center;">Gandhi played a prominent role in the planned campaign.  As a talented letter-writer and meticulous planner, he was assigned the task of compiling all petitions, arranging meetings with politicians and addressing letters to newspapers. He also campaigned in India and made an, initially, successful appeal to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Ripon. He was instrumental in the formation of the Natal Indian Congress (NIC) on 22 August 1894, which marked the birth of the first permanent political organisation to strive to maintain and protect the rights of Indians in South Africa.</p>
            <p style="padding: 0px 100px; text-align: center;">He battled against declaring non-Christian unions invalid in 1913. Gandhi spearheaded yet another nonviolent protest against the discrimination against Indian communities in the Transvaal. About 2,000 Indians followed him as he led them over the Transvaal boundary. Gandhi resided in South Africa for 21 years in total. By the time Gandhi’s visit was over, the government had adopted the Indian Relief Act, which complied with many of their requests.</p>

          <h2>Champaran Movement</h2>

          <div class="text">
            <div class="text-column">
              <p>During the British colonial era in India, the Champaran peasant movement emerged as a farmers' uprising in the Champaran district of Bihar. The Champaran peasant movement commenced in 1917-18 with the aim of galvanizing peasants to resist European planters.The British rulers have imposed a system called Tinkathia, which forces them to grow indigo plant on 15% of their land, and, additionally, pay tax; failing to comply invites serious consequences like getting tied to a tree and thrashed, or having cattle confiscated and farms and houses auctioned. The indigo produce will go to the British-run indigo processing factories across Champaran.</p>
              <p>The British authorities did not want Gandhi to visit Champaran. The evening he reached Motihari, in Champaran — April 15, 1917 — he heard about a tenant’s mistreatment in Jasaulpatti village. The following morning, he made his way to the village on elephant back, but was summoned by the district magistrate midway. “I order you to abstain from remaining in the district, which you are required to leave by the next available train,” the order, delivered by a policeman on a bicycle, stated.Gandhi declined. “Out of a sense of public responsibility, I feel it to be my duty to say that I am unable to leave the district but if it so pleases the authorities, I shall submit to the order by suffering the penalty of disobedience.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-column">
              <p>Starting April 22, and over the following months, Gandhi set out to collect testimonies of tenants from nearby villages.By June 4, over 7,000 cultivators from 850 villages recorded their statements. Gandhi ensured that the cultivators were cross-questioned to prove the veracity of their claims; he even invited British officials to witness the proceedings, and often met the planters to hear their versions as well. These were compiled and handed over to Lieutenant Governor Sir Edward Gait.The report eventually led to the Champaran Agrarian Act, 1918, which abolished coercive indigo farming.</p>
              <p> Within a few months, volunteers from across the country joined him, and eventually, they started six schools for foundational learning in Bihar because of the conditions of children in Bihar. More followed later.</p>

              <p>Kheda Satyagraha was launched on March 11, 1918, in Kheda District of Gujarat (the then Bombay province). The movement was initially started by the peasants themselves with the help of a local leader, Mohanlal Pandya. It mainly involved the peasant-Patidar community of Kheda, which later involved the leadership of Gandhi. Their demand was the non-payment of the revenue against the backdrop of crop failure, a rise in prices, and the government’s insensitive increase in the tax rate.Kheda Satyagraha was the first time when Gandhi adopted a non-cooperation movement in India.</p>
              <p></p>
              <h3>Causes of Kheda Satyagraha</h3>
              <p></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bad harvest: There was a bad harvest in 1917–18, coinciding with the price surge of essentials.</li>
                <li>Plague: Gujarat suffered significantly from the severe plague in 1918, with 16,740 deaths recorded in Kheda alone. Due to these reasons, the peasant-Patidar community refused to pay the raised taxes.</li>
                <li>Increase in tax: In the Bombay Presidency, of which Gujarat was a part, the British government increased taxes by 23 per cent between 1917-18. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="text-column">
              <p>When Gandhi arrived in Bombay in February 1918, he made the decision to personally investigate the suffering of peasants. While visiting the villages in Kheda with other Gujarat Sabha members, Gandhi discovered justification for the demand of the peasants to suspend revenue collection. Getting no assurance from the government on the demands of peasants, Gandhi decided at a meeting of the Gujarat Sabha to resort to Satyagraha. In a meeting at Nadiad on March 22, 1918, Gandhi urged the volunteers to take a sacred pledge, which was not to pay the assessment for the year, whether wholly or in part.Gandhi personally visited Kheda villages and urged Satyagrahis to uphold the promise. Despite being detained for defying the government, Pandya and other local leaders gained a lot of support from their community. </p>
              <p>The Kheda Satyagraha of 1918 was a major turning point in the Indian independence movement. It helped to establish Gandhi’s reputation as a leader of the Indian people. The Satyagraha had important outcomes such as The government did not collect revenue from peasants and also did not confiscate their lands, the land tax was levied only on those who were able to pay it and the return of the property to the legitimate owners of the seized land was also accomplished with everyone's assistance.Then Gandhi decided to withdraw from the struggle (despite peasants not receiving all the demands).</p>

            <p>The Khilafat Movement was a political campaign launched by Indian Muslims in British India from 1919 to 1922. It aimed to protest against British policies towards Turkey and the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. The movement sought to address the grievances of Turkey and promote Hindu-Muslim unity. The movement ended in 1922 after the conclusion of the non-cooperation movement.The leading cause was the fear of the disappearance of Khilafat or the Islamic Caliphate.Another cause was the feeling of betrayal among Indian Muslims. During the war, India supported the British by sending troops to fight with the Allies. The British had promised to safeguard Islamic interests after the war. However, now they were planning to dissolve the Ottoman Empire. This upset the Indian Muslims and made them feel betrayed.</p>
            <p>Gandhi's support gave the movement a major boost. Gandhi saw an opportunity to form a Hindu-Muslim alliance against the British. He linked the Khilafat issue with India's freedom struggle. His participation brought more people into the movement and gave it mass appeal.Gandhi linked Khilafat with India's freedom struggle. He declared non-cooperation as the means to fight for both. His participation galvanized the movement and attracted Indians of all religions. Gandhi organized a Khilafat delegation to demand Muslim rights from the British. This increased the movement's prominence and forced the British to take notice. Gandhi's civil disobedience and non-cooperation provided Muslims with a structure to participate in protests.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-column">
            <p>The Khilafat Movement united Hindus and Muslims. Before this movement, Hindus and Muslims did not cooperate much with each other. Hindus supported the Muslims in this movement. This helped reduce communal tensions for some time. It strengthened the Indian National Congress. It increased communal tensions over time because when the Khilafat Movement failed, Muslims distrusted the Congress. And Hindus blamed Muslims for the movement's failure. This increased mutual suspicion between the communities.It weakened the concept of Indian nationalism. The movement showed that religion still had a strong pull over Indians, especially Muslims. It proved that Indian nationalism had not transcended communal identities fully. Many Muslims felt betrayed. When the movement failed, many Muslims felt that Hindus had let them down. Muslims then focused on securing political safeguards for themselves, which widened the Hindu-Muslim divide. </p>

              <p>Gandhi had realised that the British had been able to be in India only because of the co-operation they received from the Indians. Keeping this in mind, he called for a non-cooperation movement.The Non-cooperation Movement was launched on 5th September 1920 by the Indian National Congress (INC) under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. In September 1920, in Congress session in Calcutta, the party introduced the Non-Cooperation programme. The period of the non-cooperation movement is taken as September 1920 to February 1922. It signified a new chapter in the history of the Indian freedom struggle.</p>
              <p>Mahatma Gandhi was the main force behind the non-cooperation movement. In March 1920, he issued a manifesto declaring a doctrine of the non-violent non-cooperation movement. Gandhi, through this manifesto, wanted people to:
                <ol>
                <li>Adopt swadeshi principles</li>
                <li>Adopt swadeshi habits including hand spinning & weaving</li>
                <li>Work for the eradication of untouchability from society</li>
              </ol>
                Gandhi travelled across the nation in 1921 explaining the tenets of the movement.

            <div class="text-column">
              <p>Gandhiji called off the movement in February 1922 in the wake of the Chauri Chaura incident. In Chauri Chaura, Uttar Pradesh, a violent mob set fire to a police station killing 22 policemen during a clash between the police and protesters of the movement. Gandhiji called off the movement saying people were not ready for revolt against the government through ahimsa. Several leaders like Motilal Nehru and C R Das were against the suspension of the movement only due to sporadic incidents of violence.</p>

        <h1>Salt March (Dandi March)</h1>
        <div style="margin: 50px;">
          <p>The Salt March, which took place from March to April 1930 in India, was an act of civil disobedience led by Mohandas Gandhi to protest British rule in India. During the march, thousands of Indians followed Gandhi from his religious retreat near Ahmedabad to the Arabian Sea coast, a distance of some 240 miles. Britain’s Salt Act of 1882 prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt, a staple in their diet. Indian citizens were forced to buy the vital mineral from their British rulers, who, in addition to exercising a monopoly over the manufacture and sale of salt, also charged a heavy salt tax. Although India’s poor suffered most under the tax, all Indians required salt.</p>
          <p>Gandhi declared resistance to British salt policies to be the unifying theme for his new campaign of “satyagraha,” or mass civil disobedience.First, Gandhi sent a letter on March 2, 1930, to inform the Viceroy Lord Irwin that he and the others would begin breaking the Salt Laws in 10 days. Then, on March 12, 1930, Gandhi set out from his ashram, or religious retreat, at Sabermanti near Ahmedabad, with several dozen followers on a trek of some 240 miles to the coastal town of Dandi on the Arabian Sea. There, Gandhi and his supporters were to defy British policy by making salt from seawater. All along the way, Gandhi addressed large crowds, and with each passing day an increasing number of people joined the salt satyagraha. By the time they reached Dandi on April 5, Gandhi was at the head of a crowd of tens of thousands of protestors. He spoke and led prayers and early the next morning walked down to the sea to make salt. In January 1931, Gandhi was released from prison. He later met with Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, and agreed to call off the satyagraha in exchange for an equal negotiating role at a London conference on India’s future.</p>

        <h1>Quit India Movement</h1>
        <div style="margin: 50px;">
        <p>
          The Quit India Movement, also known as the August Movement, was a significant phase in the Indian struggle for independence from British rule. Initiated by Mahatma Gandhi on August 8, 1942, during World War II, the movement called for an end to British rule in India. Gandhi’s powerful rallying cry, "Do or Die," aimed to galvanize Indian resistance through non-violent means, urging an immediate and orderly British withdrawal.</p>
          <p>The British government responded with severe repression. Thousands of activists, including major leaders of the Indian National Congress, were arrested, and public assemblies were banned. Despite the leadership vacuum, spontaneous uprisings and acts of sabotage spread across the country, from urban centers to rural villages, significantly disrupting British administration.</p>
          <p>The movement did not lead directly to independence, nor did it sustain the peak levels of disruption for an extended period due to heavy suppression. However, it fundamentally weakened British authority and resolve. The British government recognized that controlling an increasingly restless India was becoming untenable. Post World War II, weakened and financially strained, Britain found it difficult to manage its empire. The Quit India Movement had sowed the seeds of British exit, which eventually culminated in India's independence in 1947. </p>

        <p>He was killed following a prayer vigil in New Delhi on January 30, 1948. His killer was Nathuram Vinayak Godse, a Hindu fanatic who believed Gandhi had been too conciliatory to the Indian subcontinent’s large Muslim minority.About 5:15 PM, Gandhi and his two granddaughters left Birla House, where he had been living, with the intent of leading his followers to a nearby summer pagoda where he often made his evening devotions. Nathuram Godse approached the frail politician, greeted him, then fired three shots at close range from a small-calibre revolver that he had hidden in his clasped hands, striking Gandhi in the upper thigh, abdomen, and chest. As Gandhi fell to the ground, he put his hand to his forehead in the Hindu gesture of forgiveness. Godse and an accomplice, Narayan Apte, were executed by hanging on November 15, 1949; the other six were sentenced to life in prison.</p>
